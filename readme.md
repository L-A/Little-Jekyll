# Little Jekyll

## **Development paused** (11/11/2016)

Since Jekyll has recently moved to [gem-based themes](http://jekyllrb.com/news/2016/07/26/jekyll-3-2-0-released/), my method for including an install-less Jekyll conflicts with the direction they are taking.

It also (in my opinion) adds more obstacles to the learning steps that a beginner might take in learning to build for the web, which goes against the general mission I gave myself with Little Jekyll.
